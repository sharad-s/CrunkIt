# 😩☝🏽Crunk It 😳👊🏽

This is a very simple React app which auto-watermarks uploaded audio.

This app was made to test my custom fork of @jackedgson 's package [crunker](https://github.com/jackedgson/crunker).

This will be used at [Trakz.co](http://trakz.co) to watermark every beat a producer uploads to the site, so that their public-facing content is protected at the very base layer.

You can try this app out here: [Demo](https://stark-plains-38840.herokuapp.com/)
